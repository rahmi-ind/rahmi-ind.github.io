## Implement RFM Analysis & Sales Prediction on E-Commerce Dataset
In this project, I aimed to gain insights into customer behavior and enhance sales through advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Utilized the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis approach to segment customers based on their past purchasing behavior. This segmentation provided valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved sales.

- **Sales Prediction**: Employed an LSTM model using TensorFlow to develop a robust sales prediction model. This model helped forecast future sales trends, enabling better inventory management and strategic planning.

- **Web Application Prototype**: Built a web app prototype using Streamlit to visualize and interact with the segmentation and prediction results. This prototype enabled stakeholders to explore the data and insights easily.

## Customer Churn Prediction
Customer churn prediction aims to identify customers likely to discontinue using our services. In this project, I undertook the following tasks:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Addressed data quality issues by handling invalid customer IDs, missing values, outliers, and non-standard values to ensure robust analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the data and uncover important patterns and trends.

- **Machine Learning**: Applied various machine learning algorithms using Scikit Learn to predict customer churn, enhancing the ability to retain at-risk customers.

## Business Dashboard with Tableau
In this project, I developed a effective and informative business dashboard using Tableau to monitor and analyze sales performance. The dashboard includes essential metrics and dynamic visualizations that provide actionable insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making. It enables stakeholders to track sales trends, identify growth opportunities, and optimize sales strategies through an intuitive and interactive interface.
